## Installation

Magitek is a precompiled routine, which is different than some others. In order to get started as a user, follow these steps.

1. Download the [latest version](https://ddjx48xxp2d6i.cloudfront.net/Magitek.zip).
2. Right click the zip, select properties, and check the "Unblock" option. This is necessary because the zip file includes a dll.
3. Unzip into your `RebornBuddy\Routines` folder.

Magitek automatically updates when Reborn Buddy is started, there is no need to add Magitek to an autoupdater like RepoBuddy.

## Compiling from Source

Fork the repo and compile.
